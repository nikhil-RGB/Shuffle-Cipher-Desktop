A desktop application to encrypt your plain text!
This desktop java GUI application helps you mantain privacy by encrypting simple text and turning it unreadable via
a simple Cipher algorithm designed by Nikhil Narayanan.<br>
The application GUI is built in SWING.<br>
Download the Encrypter zip file from the releases section to use the product.<br> 
To read the source code, go into the Encrypter folder and  view all the source code files:EncrypterFrontEnd.java contructs and controls the java gui, while the SimpleCipher class manages the shuffling of the input strings and the unshuffling of the ASCII values.<br>
This project is open source.<br>
