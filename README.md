# Shuffle-Cipher-Desktop
A desktop application to encrypt your plain text!
This desktop java GUI application helps you mantain privacy by encrypting simple text and turning it unreadable via
a simple Cipher algorithm designed by Nikhil Narayanan.<br>
The application GUI is built in SWING.<br>
Download the Encrypter zip file from the releases section to use the product.<br> 
To read the source code, go into the Encrypter folder and  view all the source code files:EncrypterFrontEnd.java contructs and controls the java gui, while the SimpleCipher class manages the shuffling of the input strings and the unshuffling of the ASCII values.<br>
This project is open source.<br>
For more detailed insights on the working of the Shuffle Cipher Desktop app, check out the README of the Shuffle Cipher Web version 
[from here](https://github.com/nikhil-RGB/Shuffle-Cipher-Web/blob/main/README.md).<br>
Due to minor implementation differences, the desktop version and web version are not compatible currently.
